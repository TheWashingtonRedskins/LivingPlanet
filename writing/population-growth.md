# Population Growth
The global population has, for most of human history, has grown at a very slow and steady rate. Until about eight hundred years ago, population roughly doubled every thousand years.
In 0 AD, after thousands of years of human history, world population was a mere one-hundred seventy million, or less than the population of modern Nigeria.  
In the next thousand years, population grew to only about three-hundred million people--less  than the population of the USA today.
Since then, the global population has grown by more than a factor of twenty to over seven billion! World population finally reached one billion in 1800 and two billion in 1927. In 1999, there were six million humans on Earth. Twelve years later, in 2011, there were seven billion; our population grew more in a dozen years than it had in the ten thousand years prior to 1800.


## Causes of Population Growth
Population growth can be primarily explained by three factors: improved food distribution, better sanitation, and modern medicine. 
Until recently, similar birth rates and death rates kept population relatively stable.
The average family has always had multiple children, but historically most children did not live to adulthood.
During the Industrial Revolution, however, this rapidly changed; improvements in science and technology allowed or more food production, proper waste disposal, and the beginnings of modern medicine drastically reduced the death rate. Because the birth rate did not change much, population growth rate skyrocketed (and only continued to increase with new advancements).

## Facts of Population Growth


## Consequences of Overpopulation
Overpopulation is the result of our population growth and will only become a bigger and more prevalent problem unless we take action now. 
The world is limited in resources and is currently unable to support more than one out of five people living in the world today.
Critics of population growth "argue that if we don't sharply lower birth rates, we are raising death rates by default." 
It's worth nothing that most of these issues are causes and effects of each other; that is, the exacerbation of one problem worsens another.

### Disease
A larger population means more potential victims of infections and more carriers of disease.
Though advances in medicine have largely protected us from disease, highly contaigous diseases (e.g. HIV, H1N1, and Ebola) are more likely than ever to cause pandemics because of the ease of spreading.

### Water Shortages
About one billion people already lack sufficient access to water for drinking, agriculture, and sanitation. Aquafiers and resevoirs are being depleated faster than ever around the world and melting glaciers are threatening to ruin them. The issue of water shortages can only get worse with more dependents and sources of contamination.

### Global Hunger
Currently, one billion people go to sleep hungry consistently and twenty-five thousand others every day die of malnutrition and hunger-related diseases.
So much land is already dedicated to agriculture that increasing food production and distribution to ensure that these billion are fed, let alone the next billion, seems impossible.
A growing population will lead to more hunger and starvation in the future unless the rate is significantly reduced.

### The Atmosphere
Overpopulation has caused two major problems with the atmosphere: the greenhouse effect and degradation of the ozone layer.
The greenhouse effect comes from "greenhouse" gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that trap heat on our planet. Many argue that our current carbon dioxide levels are natural since carbon dioxide levels are cyclical. While it is true that CO2 levels cycles with glacial cycles, the current CO2 levels are 30% or 90 ppi greater than the historical maximum--rather clear evidence that the current carbon dioxide levels are due to the massive overpopulation issue. As energy demands increase, so too will the emissions of greenhouse gases and the strength of the climate change-inducing greenhouse effect.  
The ozone layer is a thin atmospheric layer that protects Earth's inhabitants from the sun's harmful UV rays. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), a (formerly) widely used refrigerant, propellant, and solvent, are responsible for much of the ozonal damage. Thankfully, in one of the few moments where humans globally took a stand for the environment, CFCs were banned under the [Montreal Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol) in many developed countries. Had the issue not been contained, the use of aerosols and other CFC-containing materials could have led to much greater ozone degradation with population growth. Unfortunately, the ozone layer is slow to repair, so we will continue to pay for previous generations's mistakes for the next several generations.

### The Sixth Mass Extinction
The Sixth Mass Extinction, also referred to as the Holocene Extinction, is the extinction of many of the world's plant and animal species largely due to human activity. 
Often times these species are accustomed to a certain type of environment and for one reason or anther, the impact of humans has destroyed those environments. 
Sometimes we introduce invasive species that devastate a balanced ecosystem, or we dump our industrial waste into an ecosystm and damage that environement's food supply. 
Though it may not seem like this affects us humans directly, we are changing the way our foodweb works by killing off certain species. 
There is a cascading effect that we have already started to feel and overpopulation is not helping. As we continue to overpopulate the Earth and expand to new regions of the world, the issue of the Sixth Mass Extinction can only get worse.
