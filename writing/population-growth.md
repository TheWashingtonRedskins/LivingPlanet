# Population Growth
The global population has, for most of human history, has grown at a very slow and steady rate. Until about eight hundred years ago, population roughly doubled every thousand years.
In 0 AD, after thousands of years of human history, world population was a mere one-hundred seventy million, or less than the population of modern Nigeria.  
In the next thousand years, population grew to only about three-hundred million people--less  than the population of the USA today.
Since then, the global population has grown by more than a factor of twenty to over seven billion! World population finally reached one billion in 1800 and two billion in 1927. In 1999, there were six million humans on Earth. Twelve years later, in 2011, there were seven billion. Our population grew more in a dozen years than it had in the ten thousand years prior to 1800.

## Causes of Population Growth
Population growth can be primarily explained by three factors: improved food distribution, better sanitation, and modern medicine. 
Until recently, similar birth rates and death rates kept population relatively stable.
The average family has always had multiple children, but historically most children did not live to adulthood.
During the Industrial Revolution, however, this rapidly changed; improvements in science and technology allowed or more food production, proper waste disposal, and the beginnings of modern medicine drastically reduced the death rate. Because the birth rate did not change much, population growth rate skyrocketed (and only continued to increase with new advancements).

## Consequences of Overpopulation
Overpopulation is the result of our population growth and will only become a bigger and more prevalent problem unless we take action now. The world is limited in resources and is currently unable to support more than one out of five people living in the world today. Critics of population growth "argue that if we don't sharply lower birth rates, we are raising death rates by default." 

These advancemets have their side effects, though, as our current rate of population growth is unsustainable.
