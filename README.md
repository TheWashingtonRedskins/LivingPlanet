We wanted to create an engaging web experience where users can learn about the changing environment of our planet, and how humans affect it. We also wanted to cover the important issue of overpopulation and how this affects our society.

We used modern web techonologies like Meteor.JS and several visualization libraries to create an immersive browser-based web app.
