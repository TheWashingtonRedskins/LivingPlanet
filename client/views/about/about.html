# The Washington Redskins

We are five high-school students from Los Angeles, only one of whom actually plays football.
Our name was inspired by South Park episode ["Go Fund Yourself" (Season 18, Episode 1)](http://southpark.cc.com/full-episodes/s18e01-go-fund-yourself) and we in no other way affiliated with the National Football League team of the same name.

Please support us and share your experiences/money with us on our [team page](https://www.facebook.com/thewashingtonredskinshack)!

`Ethan`'s experience lies primarily with Java, although he has dabbled in and is learning other languages. He has published two applications: [En Garde](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ethanmad.fencingscorekeeper), an Android fencing score-keeping app, and [HyperTyper](http://ethanmad.com/HyperTyper), a Chrome extension that helps (cheats) in online typing competitions. He has little experience with the Web outside of static websites, so he is looking to learn a lot with The Washington Redskins.

`David` is passionate about teaching others how to 'Kode', as demonstrated by his project, [Koding 4 Kids](http://koding4kids.com). Right now, however, his teaching is on hold until we teach y'all a lesson.

`Christian`, also known as 'quantum' or '[paralin](http://parl.in)' is known primarily for [D2Moddin](http://paral.in/the-d2moddin-project/), which brought custom game modes to over 174,000 DOTA 2 players. Christian's in-progress projects include two other DOTA projects, WebLeague and DotaReplay, in addition to his VTOL PixHawk autonomous UAV project. Previous projects are listed on [his website](http://paral.in/projects/) with links to GitHub repositories.

`James` is an algorithms expert and is top 50 on the USACO rankings in 2014. James actually [invented the subordinate-sequential search algorithm](https://koding.com/jlennon1) with the help of fellow Koders. James has also created several published games, including [Nebulus](https://itunes.apple.com/app/nebulous-multiplayer-space/id874328065?mt=8) and [Driftlight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/driftlight/id908131148?mt=8).

`Jake` is an esteemed hacker who often goes by the name of '4chan'. He's apparently very infamouss, but you better not tell [CNN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRcdmbC0HHs)!


## What we're making

We made a site called Living Planet in which we discuss select current problems in the world and visualize them primarily using interactive graphs and charts.
